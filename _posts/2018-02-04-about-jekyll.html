<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is one of the many tools which helped make this site a possibility. In layman's terms, Jekyll is a computer program written in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, which is run from the terminal. It allows a user to generate and host a temporary site on their computer and regenerate the display as its source code is being modified. It was essential to helping this site get off the ground!<br /><div><br /></div><div>A great benefit of this program is that the site can be updated with ease. New files and media can reach you, the readers, within mere minutes the moment they are created. All it takes are some tricks and quick keystrokes.</div><div><br /></div><div>Another one of the benefits of Jekyll is how it can auto-convert blog posts from Blogger to be uploaded into our site. Read the instructions under the "How to convert..." blog post to learn more.</div><div><br /></div><div>There are many other tools which helped make this site happen. Keep reading for more updates and new information!</div><div><br /></div><div>Thank you for reading.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Lauren Dennedy</div><br />
