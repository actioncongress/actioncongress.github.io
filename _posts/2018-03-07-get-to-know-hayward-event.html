On Saturday, February 24th, our organization hosted our first ever community event, titled Get-to-Know Hayward. We had a wonderful time together and met a few new friends along the way!
</br>
Our day started by meeting on the California State University East Bay parking lot where we would all carpool together to various locations. We spoke, laughed, and had breakfast together.
</br>
Afterwards, we volunteered to pick up trash with the Keep Hayward Green Task Force around Tyrell Elementary School.
