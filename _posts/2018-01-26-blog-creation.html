<div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;">Welcome to the first blog post of the Action Congress Organization!</div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">It is the goal of our organization to create content available quickly and conveniently. Blogger is an appropriate asset for doing just that, which is why this post coming to you right now, dear reader, is powered through Blogger.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Blogger is now a service offered by Google, which means important Action Congress members can easily access and edit the posts through the services already available to them, seeing as they have Google accounts.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Blog posts on Blogger can be easily edited later for a cleaner look or new information. They will be updated and reflected on our website in real time!</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">The posts we publish using Blogger can also be implemented directly into other domains and works well with HTML and CSS. Think of Blogger as the Google Drive of the website.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Lastly, Blogger is entirely free! With this web-based software available to us, we will be up and running in no time.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Thank you for reading.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">- Lauren Dennedy</div>
