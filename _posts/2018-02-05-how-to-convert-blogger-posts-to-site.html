I'm sure many members are curious as to how to add their own blog posts to the website. After all, this website will ideally feature the thoughts and content of all members. Once access to the Blogger list has been granted to a member, they can write their own content and publish officially on their own.<br /><br />Steps to setting up an environment to publish content straight to the site:<br /><ol><li>Make sure your device runs either GNU/Linux, Unix, or macOS. For Windows users, you can install <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>, which will allow for a "minimalist" GNU environment on Windows, facilitating development.</li><li>Download and install the latest versions of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://rubygems.org/pages/download">Ruby Gems</a>&nbsp;according to the instructions provided on those sites respectively.</li><li>Once those are ready, simply install&nbsp;<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>&nbsp;via your computer's terminal with the command:</li><ul><li>gem install jekyll</li></ul><li>Now that you have the first initial requirements to start contributing to the website, you'll need access to the site's source code, available on our <a href="https://github.com/actioncongress/actioncongress.github.io">GitHub repository</a>.</li><li>Set up a local directory to download and store the website files to. This means, when you download the source files for the website, they'll come prepackaged in a .zip. Keep them in a safe place on your computer.</li><li>Connect the directory you've created to GitHub. You'll need to create a GitHub account. For individuals who prefer to work in the terminal, all you'll need is the&nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a>&nbsp;framework itself. It will come with its own command prompt program called Git Bash. Run git commands from here. If that seems daunting to you, you can use a very nice and clean UI called&nbsp;<a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>.</li><li>Once you have your directory set up and connected to GitHub, and a blog post you've written in Blogger, download a .xml backup of the website under settings&gt;other&gt;back up content.</li><li>Run the Jekyll command tutorial listed <a href="https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/blogger/">here</a>.</li><li>Isolate your post, which should be pre-formatted to run in the site, place it in the posts folder, and commit push to GitHub. Congratulations, the post should now be automatically converted and appear on our site!</li></ol>If those steps seemed daunting, no worries. One of our site maintenance members would also be happy to do it for you. These steps are more so a guide for members who are very much a "do-it-yourself" personality, and would like to take initiative to publish content as soon as they can.<br /><ol></ol>These steps can also be considered a "How-to" on setting up a development environment in general, in case any maintenance members need a quick start guide when transferring work to new devices, or new members want to get involved.<br /><br />I hope this information has been helpful to our readers.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.<br /><br />- Lauren Dennedy<br /><br />
