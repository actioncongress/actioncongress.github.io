The last important thing I must mention which powers our site is the technology of <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, which supports <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.<br /><br /><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> works as a version control system for multiple users across different devices. Imagine if several people were working on a project together, they would want to keep track of who contributed what, what the previous states were, and the current state of the project. For Git, many of those projects are applications or websites. Users can keep track from their own devices of which files to work on, and see any history, changes, or branches of that project.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>&nbsp;takes all of the capabilities of Git, and connects them to the web. On GitHub, contributors can access with ease project files, view them with leisure in their own browser, and download versions from the web either to try out software or add to it themselves. You can even view the source code for this site at our <a href="https://github.com/actioncongress/actioncongress.github.io">GitHub repository here</a>! For curious members, please contact <a href="mailto:lauren@actioncongress.org">Lauren</a>&nbsp;about site content and changes.<br /><br /><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>&nbsp;allows for free site hosting. It is a service provided by GitHub, so that no extra fee is required to publish our website to the world wide web. (The domain name is a different story!)<br /><br />I hope these last posts help our members understand how the inner workings of the website run and operate smoothly.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.<br /><br />- Lauren Dennedy
