On Saturday, February 24th, our organization hosted our first ever community event, titled Get-to-Know Hayward. We had a wonderful time together and met a few new friends along the way!

Our day started by meeting on the California State University East Bay parking lot where we would all carpool together to various locations. We spoke, laughed, and had breakfast together.

Afterwards, we volunteered to pick up trash with the Keep Hayward Green Task Force around Tyrell Elementary School.

Thank you for reading.
